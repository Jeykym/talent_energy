# Talent Energy
This is a website I designed for my friend. Some texts are not finished yet so you may \
see some placeholder texts instead.

You can see a preview [here](https://jasasul.github.io/talent_energy/)

Thanks to this project I lerned how to properly do mobile first design and how to make it responsive. \
I used **SCSS** with **BEM** principle to make working with the **CSS** easier. \
Hamburger menu and card popup use **JavaScript** for the animations.
